# shopee_scraperv2

This has been a major project of mine that came with a ton of hurdles that halted progress multiple times. This project is composed of multiple scripts that as a whole allowed me to obtain a comprehensive dataset containing details of a shop as well as details of the products that they have. This project has not been made for reusability (at least for now) as Shopee is a huge company that has a very talented workforce which constantly update their website. Over the course of 4 months I had to constantly change the approaches I had made to successfully get the end product. This is something I do not wish to do repeatedly as it took an exhaustive amount of effort. However, I am currently working on an alternative solution that I believe could be reused in a clean and safe manner, albeit maybe only being ~90% accurate (Stay tuned!) (Maybe if I'm not lazy!).
